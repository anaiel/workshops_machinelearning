# Machine Learning Workshops by 42-AI

42-AI is a student association at the 42 school which is interested in the development of AI in the school. It organizes weekly workshops on the fundamentals of machine learning, during which a couple of students organize a presentation on an algorithm or other topic, and then offer to put this new knowledge into practise. The exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/42-AI/ateliers-ml-2019).
