    "## Extending Bag of Words by Using TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been using the Bag of Words model to represent comments as vectors. \n",
    "The \"Bag of Words\" is a list of all unique words found in the training data, then each comment can be represented by a vector that contains the frequency of each unique word that appeared in the comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example if the training data contains the words $(hi, how, my, grade, are, you),$ then the text \"how are you you\" can be represented by $(0,1,0,0,1,2).$ The main reason we do this in our application is because comments can vary in length, but the length of all unique words stays fixed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our context, the TF-IDF is a measure of how important a word is in a comment relative to all the words in our training data. For example if a word such as \"the\" appeared in most of the comments, the TF-IDF would be small as this word does not help us differentiate accross comments. \n",
    "Note that \"TF\" stands for \"Term Frequency\", and \"IDF\" stands for \"Inverse Document Frequency\". In particular, \"TF\" denoted by $tf(w,c)$ is the number of times the word $w$ appears in the given comment $c$. Whereas \"IDF\" is a measure of how much information a given word provides in differentiating comments. Specefically, $IDF$ is formulated as \n",
    "\n",
    ">$idf(w, D) = log(\\frac{\\text{Number of comments in train data $D$}}{\\text{Number of comments containing the word $w$}}).$ \n",
    "\n",
    "To combine \"TF\" and \"IDF\" together, we simple take the product, hence \n",
    ">$$TFIDF = tf(w,c) \\times idf(w, D) = (\\text{Number of times $w$ appears in comment $c$})\\times log(\\frac{\\text{Number of comments in train data $D$}}{\\text{Number of comments containing the word $w$}}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the $TF-IDF$ can be used to weight the vectors that result from the \"Bag of Words\" approach. For example, suppose a comment contains \"this\" 2 times, hence $tf = 2$. \n",
    "If we then had 1000 comments in our traininig data, and the word \"this\" appears in 100 comments, $idf = log(1000/100) = 2.$ Therefore in this example, the TF-IDF weight would be 2*2 = 4 for the word \"this\" appear twice in a particular comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To incorprate TF-IDF into the naive bayes setting, we can compute \n",
    "\n",
    ">$$Pr(word|spam) = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{c is spam}}TFIDF(word,c,D)}{\\sum_{\\text{word in spam c}}\\sum_{\\text{c is spam}}TFIDF(word,c,D)+ \\text{Number of unique words in data}},$$ \n",
